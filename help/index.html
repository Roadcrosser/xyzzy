    <h1>User Commands</h2>
        <h2>Gameplay Commands</h3>
            <p>
                These commands are available to most or all users of xyzzy, and assist in playing or controlling games.
            </p>
            <h3>The Backtick Rule</h4>
                <p>
                    All commands submitted must be flanked by <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent">Grave Accent</a></b> characters, or "Backticks" as they're known to xyzzy. This is for two reasons:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>This prevents accidental invokation, especially regarding other bots that use <code>&gt;</code>.</li>
                    <li>This causes the commands to look more visually interesting and contrasting compared to normal chat. Discord will automatically convert commands surrounded by grave characters into formatted blocks of computer code.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The grave character can be found next to the <code>1</code> key on a standard US QWERTY keyboard, and looks like this: <code>`</code>. Therefore, a proper xyzzy command should look like this before you send it:
                </p>
                <code class="block">
                    `>Command`
                </code>
                <p>
                    However, <b>the backtick rule can be turned off</b> for you if you wish.
                </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="backticks">
                >>backticks <span class="options">[ on | off ]</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Enables or disables the requirement for Xyzzy to require backticks before and after each command. This is <b>on</b> by default.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using this command only changes the setting for you.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="input">
                ><span class="options">input</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Any command submitted with a single greater than sign will be submitted to the game running inside of xyzzy. I.E., if xyzzy was playing Zork and you wanted to pick up a lantern, you would do <code>>Get lantern.</code>
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="play">
                >>play <span class="options">[ Game name ]</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Tells xyzzy to start playing the game specified in <i>[Game name]</i> in the current channel. If no game is found with that name, xyzzy will show you all games with the text of <i>[Game name]</i> in their name. If only one game is found with that text in it's name, it will start that game.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="indent">
                >>indent <span class="options">[ indent level ]</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Will make xyzzy scrap the first <i>[indent level]</i> characters for each line in his output. If you're noticing random spaces after each line break, use this command.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>[Indent level]</i> must be an integer between 0 and the total console width. (Usually 80.)
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="forcequit">
                >>forcequit <span class="options">or >>mortim</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                After confirmation, terminates the process running the xyzzy game you are playing. <b>It is recommended to try to exit the game using an in-game method before using this command.</b> <code>>quit</code> usually works.
            </p>
            <p>
                This command has an alias in <code>>>mortim</code>
            </p>
        <h2>Bot Status and Health</h2>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="list">
                >>list
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sends you a direct message containing all stories in xyzzy's library.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="nowplaying">
                >>nowplaying
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sends you a direct message containing all currently running xyzzy instances across Discord.
            </p>
            <p class="todo">
                In the future, xyzzy should only report playing games for servers you are also in unless you are in the bot's Owner ID list.
            </p>
        <h2>Moderation Commands</h3>
            <p>
                These commands are only available to users that have the permission to kick other users from the Discord server they are invoked on.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="block">
                >>block <span class="options">[ @User Mention#1234 ] or >>plugh</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                For each user mentioned, disables their ability to send commands to the bot in the server this command was invoked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blocked users will be sent a Direct Message stating that they are blocked when they try to send a command.
            </p>
            <p>
                This command has an alias in <code>>>plugh</code>
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="unblock">
                >>unblock <span class="options">[ @User Mention#1234 ]</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                For each user mentioned, reenables their ability to send commands to the bot in the server this command was invoked.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the user was never blocked, this command fails silently.
            </p>
        <h2>Debug Commands</h2>
            <p>
                These commands are only available to a specific set of users, and can be catastrophic. They are listed here for completeness.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="debug">
                >>debug <span class="options">[ python ]</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Executes arbitrary Python code.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="announce">
                >>announce <span class="options">[ Announcement ]</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                For each channel currently playing a game, sends the text in <i>[Announcement]</i>.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="output">
                >>output
            </h3>
            <p>
                Toggles whether the text being sent to this channel from a currently playing story also should be printed to the terminal. This is functionally useless in most cases.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="shutdown">
                >>shutdown
            </h3>
            <p>
                After confirmation, shuts down the bot and all running games.
            </p>
