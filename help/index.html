    <h1>User Commands</h2>
        <h2>Gameplay Commands</h3>
            <p>
                These commands are available to most or all users of xyzzy, and assist in playing or controlling games.
            </p>
            <h3>The Backtick Rule</h4>
                <p>
                    All commands submitted should be flanked by <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent">Grave Accent</a></b> characters, or "Backticks" as they're known to xyzzy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The grave character can be found next to the <code>1</code> key on a standard US QWERTY keyboard and on an iOS stock keyboard by holding down the apostrophe key and swiping left, looking like this: <code>`</code>. Therefore, a proper xyzzy command should look like this before you send it:
                </p>
                <code class="block">
                    `>command`
                </code>
                <p>
                    This backtick rule <b>is turned off by default</b> and can be enabled if you wish to enforce it for yourself.
                </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="backticks">
                >>backticks <span class="options">[ on | off ]</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Enables or disables the requirement for xyzzy to require backticks before and after each command. This is <b>off</b> by default.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using this command only changes the setting for you.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="input">
                ><span class="options">input</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Any command submitted with a single greater than sign will be submitted to the game running inside of xyzzy. I.E., if xyzzy was playing Zork and you wanted to pick up a lantern, you would do <code>>get lantern</code>.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="unprefixed">
                >>unprefixed <span class="options">[ on | off ]</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Enables or disables the requirement for game inputs to require a prefix. When enabled, this means that doing <code>get lantern</code> will work as well as <code>>get lantern</code>. If you wish to speak normally without triggering the game in this mode, you can start your message with <code>#</code> or <code>//</code> for it to be ignored. This is <b>off</b> by default.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using this command only changes the setting for you.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="play">
                >>play <span class="options">[ Game name ]</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Tells xyzzy to start playing the game specified in <i>[Game name]</i> in the current channel. If no game is found with that name, xyzzy will show you any close matches it can find, and if there is only one, start that one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, you can also attach a save file from a game with this command, and it will attempt to match a game in its database to your save and load it.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="upload">
                >>upload
            </h3>
            <p>
                Attaching a save file with this command will upload the save file to your channel instance, allowing you to use a <code>RESTORE</code> game command to load them.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="indent">
                >>indent <span class="options">[ indent level ]</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Will make xyzzy scrap the first <i>[indent level]</i> characters for each line in his output. If you're noticing random spaces after each line break, use this command.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>[Indent level]</i> must be an integer between 0 and the total console width. (Usually 80.)
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="forcequit">
                >>forcequit <span class="options">or >>mortim</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                After confirmation, terminates the process running the xyzzy game you are playing. <b>It is recommended to try to exit the game using an in-game method before using this command.</b> <code>>quit</code> usually works.
            </p>
            <p>
                This command has an alias in <code>>>mortim</code>
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="modes">
                >>modes
            </h3>
            <p>
                Lists and describes all possiblle game input modes.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="mode">
                >>mode <span class="options">[ anarchy | democracy | driver ]</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sets a game input mode if a game is running on the current channel.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="transfer">
                >>trasfer <span class="options">@mention#1234</span>
            </h3>
            <p>

        <h2>Moderation Commands</h3>
            <p>
                These commands are only available to users that have the permission to kick other users from the Discord server they are invoked on.
            </p>
            <h3 class="xyzzy-command" id="block">
                >>block <span class="options">[ @User Mention#1234 ] or >>plugh</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
                For each user mentioned, disables their ability to send commands to the bot in the server this command was invoked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blocked users will be sent a Direct Message stating that they are blocked when they try to send a command.
            </p>

                If the user was never blocked, this command fails silently.
            </p>
        <h2>Debug Commands</h2>
