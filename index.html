Mechanical whirrs are heard from throughout the complex, but you don't have time to worry about that right now. The construct stands before you, xyzzy.</div>
<div id='command'>>x xyzzy</div>
<div id='response'>The construct appears to you as an ancient computer, one from the Old Age, a cream-colored CRT Monitor with a cream-colored keyboard in front of it. The tower sits next to the monitor, whirring away. You sense a magical aura connecting this construct to Discord's servers.<br>
<br>
A single line is displayed on the monitor, which reads <span id='green'>AWAITING INPUT</span>.</div>
<div id='command'>>press key</div>
<div id='response'>You press a key on the keyboard, and the screen goes blank. The whirring intensifies, as it feels to be coming from all around you. You soon feel a sense of dizziness, before passing out.</div>
</div>
<div id='aaa'>
<span style="font-family: 'Anonymous Pro';">You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Comfortaa';">The first ray of sunlight lances through the slats in the window-blind. It strikes your eyes, and you feel yourself <i>go</i></span>.<br>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif;">Oh, no - how long have you been asleep? Sure, it was a tough night, but... This is bad. This is very bad.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;">Pig lost! Boss say that it Grunk fault.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Alegreya', serif;">You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Kaushan Script', cursive;">You come around a corner, away from the noise of the opening. There is only one exhibit.</span>

<div id='response'>xyzzy is a Discord Bot that plays IF games. It's also currently in development. I wasted too much of my time making this webpage as well. The buttons don't even work, don't bother trying to click them.</div>
